            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I became a web developper because the possibilities are endless. I have a background in information technology, business and finance.
            However, knowing that there is so much that can be done with programming and that this is where the future lies, I decided to take on the challenge.
            My passion for sports(Soccer, Baseball, MMA) from a young age has made me a natural challenge seeker and a great team player. Having both worked in sales and customer service
            has hone my communication skills on top of the fact that I also speak English, French and Haitian Creole all fluently.</p>
