# Portfolio

I wanted a portfolio that was simple, easy to read and most importantly professional. 

This is what I achieved with what I consider to be a first draft. With time I should be able to add more to display my technical skills.
With this level of simplicity, it's hard to for a potential employer to see what I'm capable of. However, by keeping the protfolio simple and straight forward
and adding more projects I belive I could have the best of both worlds. 

My goal being simplcity, I chose a font that is not too over the top. For my choice of colors, I read somewhere that blue is the easiest color on the eyes.
A person can look at it for a longer periods of time without strain. 

I used the Bootstrap styling framework to help with the styling. At first there was no particuler intention behind it, it seemed interesting 
and i wanted to give it a try. Afterwards I was glad I did. It got me starting very quickliy and allowed me to do certain things that would otherwise take forever.
It was a great help to me given the amount of time I had. Although I haven't "mastered" it, it will definitely not be my last time using it 
and I'm loking forward to its other capabilities.
